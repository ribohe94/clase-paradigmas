;Generate the combinations of K distinct objects chosen from the N elements of a list

;In how many ways can a committee of 3 be chosen from a group of 12 people? We all
;know that there are C(12,3) = 220 possibilities (C(N,K) denotes the well-known binomial
;coefficients). For pure mathematicians, this result may be great. But we want to really
;generate all the possibilities in a list.

(define (combination k xs) 
   (cond [(null? xs) '()] 
         [(= k 1) (map list xs)] 
         [else (append (map (lambda (x) (cons (car xs) x)) 
                            (combination (- k 1) (cdr xs))) 
                       (combination k (cdr xs)))]))
